# HeaderGenerator
This MATLAB script generates a standardized header for files, including the file name, programmer's name, date, and MATLAB version. It comes in two versions: a GUI version for direct integration into MATLAB files and an M-file version.

## Important Note: Choose either one to download or save both of the file in different name to avoid error
